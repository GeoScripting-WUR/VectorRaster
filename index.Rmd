# Today's learning objectives

At the end of the lecture, you should be able to
* Have an overview of what can be achived when combining raster and vector data in R
* Be able to extract raster data using vector data

# Introduction

In the previous lectures we saw how to deal with [raster](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToRaster/) data using R, as well as how to deal with [vector](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToVector/) data and the multiple classes of the sp package. In the current lesson, we'll see what can be done when the two worlds of vector data and raster data intersect.

# Conversions

You will find some utilities in R to convert data from raster to vector format and vice-versa. However, whenever you start converting objects, you should wonder whether you are taking the right approach to solve your problem. An approach that does not involve converting your data from vector to raster or the opposite should almost always be preferred.

As a result, because these functions are only useful for some very particular situations, I only give below a brief description of them.

## Vector to raster

There is one function that allows to convert an object in vector to a raster object. It is the `rasterize()` function.

## Raster to vector

Three functions allow to convert raster data to vector; the `rasterToPoints()`, `rasterToContour`, and `rasterToPolygons()` functions. The latter can be useful to convert the result of a classification. In that case, set `dissolve =` to `TRUE` so that the polygons with the same attribute value will be dissolved into multi-polygon regions. This option requires the rgeos package.

# Geometric operations

Raw raster data do not usually conform to any notion of administrative or geographical boundaries. Vector data (and extents) can be used to mask or crop data to a desired region of interest.

## crop

Cropping consists in reducing the extent of a spatial object to a smaller extent. As a result, the output of `crop()` will automatically be rectangular and will not consider any features such as polygons to perform the subsetting. It is often useful to crop data as tightly as possible to the area under investigation to reduce the amount of data and have a more focused view when visualizing the data.

Crop uses objects of class `extent` to define the new extent, or any object that can be coerced to an extent (see `?extent` for more info on this). This means that practically all spatial objects (raster or vector) can be used directly in crop. Considering two raster objects `r1` and `r2` with `r2` smaller than `r1`, you can simply use `crop(r1, r2)` in order to crop `r1` to the extent of `r2`.

You can easily define an extent interactively (by clicking) thanks to the `drawExtent()` function.

## Mask

Mask can be used with almost all spatial objects to mask (= set to `NA`), values of a raster object. When used with a *SpatialPolygon* object, mask will keep values of the raster overlayed by polygons and mask the values outside of polygons.

Note the very useful `inverse=` argument of `mask()`, which allows to mask the inverse of the area covered by the features. We will use this feature of mask later in the tutorial to exclude water areas of a raster, defined in an independent *SpatialPolygons* object.
 
# Extract

The most common operation when combining vector and raster data is the extraction. It simply consists in extracting the values of a raster object for locations specified by a vector object. The object can be one of the class of the *sp* package, or an *extent* object.

When using `extract()` with *SpatialPolygons* or *SpatialLines*, individual features of the vector layer may overlay or intersecting several pixels. In that case a function (`fun =`) can be used to summarize the values into one. Note that although most often the function `min`, `max`, `mean` and `median` functions are used for the spatial aggregation and also any custom made function can be used. `extract()` provides many options for the return object, such as a data frame or a new sp object with extracted values appended to the attribute table. See `?extract()` example section.

# Examples

## A simple land cover classification of Wageningen from Landsat 8 data

In the example below we will do a simple supervised land cover classification of Wageningen. The example uses the same data as you used in the [exercise](http://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToRaster/#exercise-design-a-pre-processing-chain-to-assess-change-in-ndvi-over-time) of the raster lesson.

Step by step we will:

- Download the Landsat 8 data of Wageningen
- Download and prepare administrative boundary data of the Netherlands
- Download Water area data of Wageningen
- Mask the data to match the boundaries of the city
- Mask the data to exclude water bodies
- Build a calibration dataset using Google Earth image interpretation
- Export the Google Earth file and import it in R
- Extract the surface reflectance values for the calibration pixels
- Calibrate a model with the classifier
- Predict the land cover using a Landsat image

### Prepare the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(raster)
# Download, unzip and load the data
download.file(url = 'https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/VectorRaster/raw/gh-pages/data/landsat8.zip', destfile = 'landsat8.zip', method = 'auto')

unzip('landsat8.zip')
# Identify the right file
landsatPath <- list.files(pattern = glob2rx('LC8*.grd'), full.names = TRUE)

wagLandsat <- brick(landsatPath)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(raster)
wagLandsat <- brick('data/LC81970242014109LGN00.grd')
```

We can start by visualizing the data, since it is a multispectral image, we can use `plotRGB()` to do so.


```{r, fig.align='center'}
# plotRGB does not support negative values, so that they need to be removed
wagLandsat[wagLandsat < 0] <- NA
plotRGB(wagLandsat, 5, 4, 3)
```

```{r}
# Download municipality boundaries
nlCity <- raster::getData('GADM',country='NLD', level=2)
class(nlCity)
# Investigate the structure of the object
head(nlCity@data)
```

It seems that the municipality names are in the `NAME_2` column. So that we can subset the SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to the city of Wageningen alone. To do so we can use simple data frame manipulation/subsetting syntax.


```{r}
nlCity@data <- nlCity@data[!is.na(nlCity$NAME_2),] ## remove rows with NA
wagContour <- nlCity[nlCity$NAME_2 == 'Wageningen',]
```

We can use the resulting `wagContour` object, to mask the values out of Wageningen, but first, since the two objects are in different coordinate systems, we need to reproject one to the projection of the other.

> **Question:** Would you rather reproject a raster or a vector layer? Give two reasons why you would choose to reproject a raster or vector.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load rgdal library (needed to reproject data)
library(rgdal)
wagContourUTM <- spTransform(wagContour, CRS(proj4string(wagLandsat)))
```

Now that the two objects are in the same CRS, we can do the masking and visualize the result. Let's first crop and then mask, to see the difference.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Example of crop and mask'}
wagLandsatCrop <- crop(wagLandsat, wagContourUTM)
wagLandsatSub <- mask(wagLandsat, wagContourUTM)

# Set graphical parameters (one row and two columns)
opar <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotRGB(wagLandsatCrop, 5, 4, 3, main = 'Crop()')
plotRGB(wagLandsatSub, 5, 4, 3, main = 'Mask()')
plot(wagContourUTM, add = TRUE, border = "green", lwd = 3)
# Reset graphical parameters
par(opar)
```

In the figure above, the left panel displays the output of crop, while the second panel shows the result of masking the Landsat scene using the contour of Wageningen as input.

We also have a water mask of Wageningen in vector format. Let's download it and also reproject it to the CRS of the Landsat data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
download.file(url = 'https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/VectorRaster/raw/gh-pages/data/wageningenWater.zip', destfile = 'wageningenWater.zip', method = 'auto')
unzip('wageningenWater.zip')
# Check the names of the layers for input in readOGR()
ogrListLayers('Water.shp')
water <- readOGR('Water.shp', layer = 'Water')
waterUTM <- spTransform(water, CRS(proj4string(wagLandsat)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
water <- readOGR('data/Water.shp', layer = 'Water')
waterUTM <- spTransform(water, CRS(proj4string(wagLandsat)))
```

Note the use of `inverse = TRUE` in the code below, to *mask* the pixels the intersect with the features of the vector object.


```{r, fig.align='center'}
wagLandsatSubW <- mask(wagLandsatSub, mask = waterUTM, inverse = TRUE)
plotRGB(wagLandsatSubW, 5, 4, 3)
plot(waterUTM, col = 'blue', add = TRUE, border = 'blue', lwd = 2)
```

For the rest of the example, we'll use the `wagLandsatCrop` object, for I have a few doubts about the spatial accuracy of the two vector layers we used in the masking steps. You can check for yourself by converting them to KML and opening them in Google Earth. (Let us know during the lesson, what do you think? any solutions?)

### Build a calibration dataset in Google Earth
Below we'll see how we can deal with a calibration dataset with R, for calibrating a classifier. It involves working with SpatialPointsDataFrames, extracting reflectance data for the corresponding calibration samples, manipulating data frames and building a model that can be used to predict land cover. But first we need to build the calibration dataset (ground truth), and for that we will use Google Earth.

Open Google Earth, in ''places'', right click on ''Temporary Places'' and select ''Add -> Folder''; name it appropriately (it will be your `layer =` argument afterwards when reading the KML file). Add new placemaks to that folder, and put the interpreted land cover in the description field. Keep it to a few classes, such as agric, forest, water, urban. I also added flood, to categorize the flood plain nearby the river. When you are done (15 - 30 points), save the file.

> Note that in the approach described above, we get to decide where the calibration samples are. Another approach would be to automatically generate randomly distributed samples. This can be done very easily in R using the `sampleRandom()` function, which automatically returns a SpatialPoints objects of any given size. In the familly of spatial sampling functions, there is also `sampleRegular()` (for regular sampling) and `sampleStratified()`, which can be used on a categorical raster (e.g. a landcover classification), to ensure that all classes are equaly represented in the sample.


### Calibrate the classifier
Load the newly created kml file using the `readOGR()` function. The object should be a SpatialPointsDataFrame and the information created is stored in the description column of the data frame.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Change to the correct file path and layer name
samples <- readOGR('sampleLongLat.kml', layer = 'sampleLongLat')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples <- readOGR('data/sampleLongLat2.kml', layer = 'sampleLongLat')
```

We now need to extract the surface reflectance values of the corresponding samples. But first the data once again need to be re-projected to the CRS of the Landsat data.

```{r}
# Re-project SpatialPointsDataFrame
samplesUTM <- spTransform(samples, CRS(proj4string(wagLandsatCrop)))
# The extract function does not understand why the object would have 3 coord columns, so we need to edit this field
samplesUTM@coords <- coordinates(samplesUTM)[,-3]
# Extract the surface reflectance 
calib <- extract(wagLandsatCrop, samplesUTM, df=TRUE) ## df=TRUE i.e. return as a data.frame
# Combine the newly created dataframe to the description column of the calibration dataset
calib2 <- cbind(samplesUTM$Description, calib)
# Change the name of the first column, for convienience
colnames(calib2)[1] <- 'lc'
# Inspect the structure of the dataframe
str(calib2)
```

> Note the use of `df = TRUE` in the `extract()` call, so that we get a data frame in return. Data frame are the most common class to work with all types of models, such as linear models (`lm()`) or random forest models as we use later.

Now we will calibrate a random forest model using the extracted data frame.
Do not focus too much on the algorithm used, the important part for this tutorial is the data extraction and the following data frame manipulation. More details will come about random forest classifiers tomorrow.


```{r}
if(!require(randomForest)) {
  install.packages("randomForest")
}
library(randomForest)
# Calibrate model
model <- randomForest(lc ~ band1 + band2 + band3 + band4 + band5 + band6 + band7, data = calib2)
# Use the model to predict land cover
lcMap <- predict(wagLandsatCrop, model = model)
```

Let's visualize the output. The function `levelplot()` from the rasterVis package is a convenient function to plot categorical raster data.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
library(rasterVis)
levelplot(lcMap, col.regions = c('green', 'brown', 'darkgreen', 'lightgreen', 'grey', 'blue'))
```

OK, we've seen better land cover maps of Wageningen, but given the amount of training data we used (14 in my case), it is not too bad. A larger calibration dataset would certainly result in a better accuracy.

## Extract raster values along a transect

Another use of the `extract()` function can be to visualize or analyse data along transects.
In the following example, we will run a transect across Belgium and visualize the change in elevation.

Let's first download the elevation data of Belgium, using the `getData()` function of the raster package.

```{r}
# Download data
bel <- getData('alt', country='BEL', mask=TRUE)
# Display metadata
bel
```

`bel` is a RasterLayer

We can start by visualizing the data.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(bel)
```

Everything seems correct.

We want to look at a transect, which we can draw by hand by selecting two points by clicking. The `drawLine()` function will help us do that. Once you run the function, you will be able to click in the plotting window of RStudio (The `bel` object should already be present in the plot panel before running `drawLine()`). Click ''Finish'' once you have selected the two extremities of the line.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
line <- drawLine()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
line <- readRDS('data/line.rds')
plot(bel)
plot(line, col = 'red', add = TRUE)
```

Then the elevation values can simply be extracted using `extract()`. Note the use of the `along.with=` argument which ensures that the samples remain in order along the segment. 

```{r}
alt <- extract(bel, line, along = TRUE)
```

We can already plot the result as follows, but the x axis does not really provide any indication of distance.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(alt[[1]], type = 'l', ylab = "Altitude (m)")
```

In order to make an index for the x axis, we can calculate the distance between the two extremities of the transect, using `distHaversine()` from the geosphere package.

```{r}
if(!require(geosphere)) {
  install.packages("geosphere")
}
library(geosphere)
# Calculate great circle distance between the two ends of the line
dist <- distHaversine(coordinates(line)[[1]][[1]][1,], coordinates(line)[[1]][[1]][2,])
# Format an array for use as x axis index with the same length as the alt[[1]] array
distanceVector <- seq(0, dist, along.with = alt[[1]])
```

> **Question**: Why can't we simply use the `LineLength()` function from the sp package?

> Hint, look at the CRS in which we are working, and at the help page of the `distHaversine()` function. Also the see `distVincentyEllipsoid()` function. Does this one provide a more accurate distance?

Note that there is a small approximation on the position of the line and the distances between the samples as the real shortest path between two points is not a straight line in lat-long, while the distance we just calculated is the shortest path. For short distances, as in the example, this is acceptable.
Otherwise, we could also have:

- Projected the raster and the line to a projected coordinate system, or
- Made a true greatCircle line using `greatCircle()` from the sp package and extracted the elevation values from it.

Let's now visualize the final output.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold'}
# Visualize the output
plot(bel, main = 'Altitude (m)')
plot(line, add = TRUE)
plot(distanceVector/1000, alt[[1]], type = 'l',
     main = 'Altitude transect Belgium',
     xlab = 'Distance (Km)',
     ylab = 'Altitude (m)',
     las = 1)

```

## Extract raster values randomly using the `sampleRandom()` function

Below is an extra example and a simplification of the random sample demo show [here](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/Scripting4Geo/). Below we use the `sampleRandom()` function
to randomly sample altitude information from a DEM of Belgium:

```{r}
## you can choose your own country here
bel <- getData('alt', country='BEL', mask=TRUE) ## SRTM 90m height data
belshp <- getData('GADM', country='BEL', level=2) ## administrative boundaries

## Sample the raster randomly with 40 points
sRandomBel <- sampleRandom(bel, na.rm=TRUE, sp=TRUE, size = 40)

## Create a data.frame containing relevant info
sRandomData <- data.frame(altitude = sRandomBel@data[[1]],
                          latitude = sRandomBel@coords[,'y'],
                          longitude = sRandomBel@coords[,'y'])
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.show='hold'}
## spatial plot
plot(bel)
plot(belshp, add=TRUE)
plot(sRandomBel, add = TRUE, col = "red")

## Altitude versus Latitude
plot(sRandomData$latitude,sRandomData$altitude, ylab = "Altitude (m)", xlab = "Latitude (degrees)")
```


> Note: If you would like to sample height data per province randomly what would you need to do?


# Exercise

## Background
Last week end, on a rainy Saturday afternoon in Wageningen, my friend and I decided to go for a coffee. We had met at the market, while shopping for fresh vegetable, when we thought of moving to a warmer and drier place to catch up a bit since last time we had met a month ago. We were both sitting in the cafe; me by the window and he, sitting on the opposite side of the table, facing the rest of the busy room. The chattering of the crown behind me, mixed with the clinking of glasses and the hissing sound of the espresso machine releasing its vapour was giving the feeling of an old movie to the place. The rain beating the window was only adding to this atmosphere. As we were discussing, I was contemplating the rain drops rolling down the glass, on the other side of the window; gaining speed and chasing each others on the smooth surface, then being pushed out of their trajectory by a sudden burst of wind, and gaining momentum again. He suddently exclaimed:

*'Did you know that Hoenderloo is the greenest city in the Netherlands?'*
  
I was shocked, not only this had absolutely nothing to do with our conversation, but also I had always thought that Wageningen was the greenest city in The Netherlands. At least that's what I wanted to believe. So that I responded:
  
*'No way man, it can't be greener than Wageningen. Wageningen is way greener than Hoenderloo.'* Insisting on the "way" and pronouncing Hoenderloo in an english way.
  
*'Are you sure?'*
  
*'Definitely!'* I had no idea.
  
To what he responded, noticing my bluffing face:
  
*'Haha, if only we could check.'*
  
''If only ...'', these two words kept bouncing in my mind. So much that I could not follow the rest of our conversation. Whether he was talking about the influence of China on Wageningen architecture, the maximum speed of a Leopard chasing a Gazelle, his last trip to Bolivia or the true origin of the french fries name, I do not remember. I was obsessed by this thought; how could I find which was the greenest place? He did most of the talking, while my mind was trying to organize the ideas and sort preliminary hypotheses. When suddently he got my attention again:
  
*'Hey let's go!'*
  
The rain had stopped. We got up, paid our coffees to the counter, exited the cafe and each started walking in a different direction. I had almost reached the end of the street when I turned around and shouted in his direction.
  
*'I think we can check!'*
  
*'Check what?'*
  
I gave him a sign with my arm indicating that it didn't matter and kept walking home.

## Exercise

Please help me find out which city in the Netherlands is the greenest. You can use the MODIS NDVI data available [here](https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/VectorRaster/raw/gh-pages/data/MODIS.zip).

- Find the greenest city
	- In January
	- In August
	- On average over the year
- Make at least one map to visualize the results

[Click here for more information about MODIS data used (i.e. MOD13A3)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod13a3)

Bonus: What about provinces (see `?raster::aggregate`). Which province is the greenest in January?
